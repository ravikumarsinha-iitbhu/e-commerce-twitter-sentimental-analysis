                                             Twitter Sentiment Analysis 
Sentiment Analysis:-

Sentiment analysis is the automated process of identifying and classifying subjective information in text data. This might be an opinion, a judgment, or a feeling about a particular topic or product feature.
The most common type of sentiment analysis is ‘polarity detection’ and involves classifying statements as Positive, Negative or Neutral.
Sentiment analysis uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to make sense of human language and machine learning language to automatically deliver accurate results.

                                                        Tools
In this project I have used following listed listed tools\libraries:-

snscrape :-
To extract data(tweets) from the Twitter I have used snscrape library. Basically, snscrape is a scraping tool for social networking services (SNS). It scrapes things like users, user profiles, hashtags, searches, threads, list posts and returns the discovered items without using Twitter’s API.

NumPy:-
I have imported NumPy for mathematical and logistics operations.

Pandas: -
I have imported pandas for many data analysis operations some of them like: - to make Data Frame from the discrete Tweets and to do sentimental analysis.

Matplotlib :-
I have imported matplotlib through which I able to data visualisation as a form of ‘scatter plot,’ ‘Bar Graph’ and ‘Pie chart’ and many comparisons among various results.

NLTK :-
The Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) is a platform used for building Python programs that work with human language data for applying in statistical natural language processing (NLP)

                                                      Analysis
Here I am going to do Sentimental Analysis on "Online Shopping" as well as "Delivery Services System" under the following listed parameters :-
1. Sentimental Analysis on online shopping before covid pandemic.
2. Sentimental Analysis on online shopping during covid pandemic.
3. Sentimental Analysis on willingness of adpoting online shopping .
4. Sentimental analysis on delivery Services System in online shopping.

                                                      Outcomes
At last I am going to do "Comparison of Sentimental Analysis" on following listed parameters :-
1. Comparison of Sentimental analysis on online shopping between before covid pandemic verses during covid pandemic. 2. Comparison of Sentimental analysis on online shopping Willingness verses Delivery Services.
3. Comparison of Sentimental analysis on online shopping between the all four parameters.\

Finally I am going to calculate "Percentage Sentimental Analysis" on 'Positive_willingness_onlineshopping' verses 'Negative_deliveryservices_onlineshopping'
